c -> concatinate method
T, F shorthand true false
6:9 sequence
vector method
as.numberic()
as.character()
LIST -> each ele can have different type
[[]] -> index 
matrix (rows, cols)
factor -> like enums
table -> freq count
unclass -> underneath values of factors
levels -> types of values in the factor
is.na()
is.nan()
data frame = tabular data
row.names
read.table. read.csv
data.matrix - from data frame
names - each element can have names

subsetting : taking a slice out of the array 
[ -> always the same class as the original- can be used to extract multiple objects
[[ -> only extract the single elemet from list or data frame
$ used to extract similar to [[ but with name of element

partial matching 
works with [[ and $ 
$ does partial matching by default
[[ you must specify exact = FALSE to allow partial matching

removing na values
create a logical vector 
bad <- is.na(x)
x[!bad] gives back the vector without na 

complete.cases(x,y) -> applied on 2 vectors and gives back the places where no missing values

complete.cases on data frame with no missing values
