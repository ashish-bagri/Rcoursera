gl <- to generate a factor level

str() method to get a snapshot of the data

## random numbers

rnorm  random normal varaites with given mean and sd
dnorm evaluate the normal probability density woth given mean and sd at a point 
pnorm eval cumulative distribution func for a normal distribution 
rpois random poisson variates with a given rate 


for every distribution ==
d density
r random
p cumulative
q quantile 

for possion, rate == mean 
rpois(10,1)

samples data form a distribution 
sample method. replace=TRUE when replacement 

from specific prob distribution with r* functions

elapsed time: wall clock time
yser time: processig time by cpu

system.time ( ) method to get timing info 

Rprof() profiler
summarize R profiler
smmaryRprof()
by.total divids the total time --. top level functions will be called by 100%
by.self() subtracts the low level function calls



do not use system time and r prof together

prints out function call stakcs 
at 0.02 seconds
