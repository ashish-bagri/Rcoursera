seq_along(x) creates a vector with index of x.
can use in loop with for (i in seq_along(x) print x[i]

can also do for (letter in x) print letter for the content directly

seq_len -> creates a sequence of the length 
used in 2d looping

mean has na.rm bool param
last statement is the return value
args(func) gives back the arguments of the function

function args are evaluated lazily. if one of the params are not used, it need not be specificed in the function call. it will not throw any error

... used as variable number of arguments when extending an existing function
also used in 'generic functions'
method - paste has the first args as ... can paste multiple strings together 
all args after ... must be named. it cannot be partially matched (makes sense as R cannot know if its for ... or for position)

binding and scoping :

when binding, it searched through environments. 
search global env. then searches through a search list. can be seen by search() on command line.

global -> users workspace
base package is last !

functions and variables have separate workspace

as.Date("1970-01-01") to convert to Date object ! 

unclass -> #days since 1970/01/01
gives the underlying object

POSIX ct and POSIXlt standard for time
ct-> seconds since etc
lt-> stores as list under the hood. keeps the data as dow, doy, month etc ! more informatic for analysis 
as.POSIXlt()
as.POSIXct()
makes the conversion
Sys.time () and can be converted etc
names(unclass(x)) underlying data structure of x
strptime -> to convert formatted string to time objects
?strptime for details
